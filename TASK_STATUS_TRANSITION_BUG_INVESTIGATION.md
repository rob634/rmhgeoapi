# Task Status Transition Bug Investigation

**Date Created**: September 3, 2025  
**Issue**: Invalid COMPLETED → FAILED task status transitions causing poison queue messages  
**Job ID**: `9969c2403b47590103f9429064acbd3b2f682d5e4c7d1174adbd2bc7c8fba262` (HelloWorld test)  
**Status**: 🔄 INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

## 🚨 Problem Summary

**What's Working:** ✅
- All 3 HelloWorld tasks completed successfully with correct results
- PostgreSQL functions are operational after schema fixes
- Task completion validation is correctly blocking invalid transitions
- Core workflow logic is functioning properly

**What's Breaking:** ❌
- Something in the system is trying to transition already-completed tasks to FAILED status
- This creates validation errors: `Invalid task status transition: TaskStatus.COMPLETED → TaskStatus.FAILED`
- Tasks get sent to poison queue after reaching MaxDequeueCount of 5
- Job progression halts despite successful task completion

## 📊 Evidence from Application Insights

### Successful Task Completion
```
2025-09-03T04:39:37: Task 9969c240...stage1_task0 COMPLETED ✅

2025-09-03T04:41:44: status_transition: Invalid task status transition: TaskStatus.COMPLETED → TaskStatus.FAILED for task 9969c240...stage1_task2
```

### Poison Queue Messages
```
2025-09-03T04:41:44: Message has reached MaxDequeueCount of 5. Moving message to queue 'geospatial-tasks-poison'
```

## 🔍 Investigation Plan

### **Phase 1: Trace the Execution Flow** 🔄

**1.1 Map the Task Completion Pipeline**
- [ ] Identify all code paths that can change task status
- [ ] Focus on queue processing → completion detection → status updates
- [ ] Look for error handling that might incorrectly mark completed tasks as failed

**1.2 Key Files to Examine**
- [ ] `function_app.py` - Queue trigger and task processing entry point
- [ ] `repository_data.py` - Task status update methods
- [ ] `adapter_storage.py` - PostgreSQL task status changes
- [ ] Any completion detection logic that calls PostgreSQL functions

### **Phase 2: Analyze the Log Timeline** 📊

**2.1 Extract Precise Error Sequence**
- [ ] Get detailed logs showing: Task completion → Status transition attempt → Validation failure
- [ ] Identify which code component is initiating the COMPLETED → FAILED transition
- [ ] Check if this happens during normal completion or error handling

**2.2 Trace Specific Task Journey**
```
Task Creation → Processing → COMPLETED ✅ → ??? → FAILED ❌ (blocked by validation)
```
- [ ] Map exact timeline from task creation to invalid transition attempt
- [ ] Identify what triggers the invalid transition ~4 minutes after completion

### **Phase 3: Examine Error Handling Logic** ⚠️

**3.1 Exception Handling Audit**
- [ ] Look for `try/catch` blocks that might mark tasks as failed after they're already completed
- [ ] Check if timeout/retry logic incorrectly processes already-completed tasks
- [ ] Examine poison queue handling that might be double-processing

**3.2 Race Condition Analysis**
- [ ] Check if multiple processes are trying to update the same task simultaneously
- [ ] Look for scenarios where completion detection runs after task is already marked complete

### **Phase 4: PostgreSQL Function Investigation** 🗄️

**4.1 Analyze Atomic Functions**
- [ ] Review `complete_task_and_check_stage()` - does it correctly handle already-completed tasks?
- [ ] Check `advance_job_stage()` - might it be trying to "fix" task states?
- [ ] Examine if functions have logic that marks completed tasks as failed

**4.2 Database State Examination**
- [ ] Check actual task states in PostgreSQL during the error
- [ ] Look for inconsistencies between database state and application logic

### **Phase 5: Code Pattern Analysis** 🔍

**5.1 Status Update Code Patterns**
- [ ] Search for all `TaskStatus.FAILED` assignments in codebase
- [ ] Look for patterns like:
```python
# ❌ Dangerous pattern:
if some_error_condition:
    update_task_status(task_id, TaskStatus.FAILED)  # No status check!
    
# ✅ Safe pattern:
if task.status != TaskStatus.COMPLETED and some_error_condition:
    update_task_status(task_id, TaskStatus.FAILED)  # Status-aware
```

**5.2 Completion Detection Logic**
- [ ] Check if "last task turns out lights" logic incorrectly processes completed tasks
- [ ] Look for retry/reprocessing that doesn't check current status

### **Phase 6: Specific Investigation Actions** 🎯

**6.1 Enhanced Logging Analysis**
- [ ] Run detailed Application Insights query for exact error sequence:
```bash
TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --resource https://api.applicationinsights.io --query accessToken -o tsv)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     "https://api.applicationinsights.io/v1/apps/829adb94-5f5c-46ae-9f00-18e731529222/query" \
     --data-urlencode 'query=traces | where timestamp >= ago(30m) | where message contains "9969c240" and (message contains "status" or message contains "transition" or message contains "update") | project timestamp, message, severityLevel | order by timestamp asc'
```

**6.2 Code Review Focus Areas**
- [ ] Search codebase for all `TaskStatus.FAILED` assignments
- [ ] Find all `update_task_status` or similar method calls
- [ ] Look for error handling in queue processing functions

**6.3 State Validation Logic Review**
- [ ] Examine the validation that's correctly catching this error
- [ ] Ensure the validation logic is in the right place (it seems to be working correctly)

### **Phase 7: Root Cause Hypothesis Testing** 🧪

**7.1 Leading Theories to Test**

**Theory 1: Double Processing** 📨
- **Hypothesis**: Task gets requeued and processed again after completion
- **Evidence to Look For**: Duplicate processing logs for same task ID
- **Test**: Check if tasks appear multiple times in queues
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

**Theory 2: Error Handler Bug** ⚠️
- **Hypothesis**: Exception handling incorrectly marks completed tasks as failed
- **Evidence to Look For**: Try/catch blocks that don't check current status
- **Test**: Review error handling code paths
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

**Theory 3: Retry Logic Issue** 🔄
- **Hypothesis**: Retry mechanism doesn't check current task status
- **Evidence to Look For**: Retry loops that blindly mark tasks as failed
- **Test**: Check retry/timeout logic
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

**Theory 4: PostgreSQL Function Bug** 🗄️
- **Hypothesis**: Atomic functions have incorrect status transition logic
- **Evidence to Look For**: Function code that marks completed tasks as failed
- **Test**: Review `complete_task_and_check_stage()` implementation
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

**Theory 5: Race Condition** 🏃‍♂️
- **Hypothesis**: Multiple threads trying to update the same completed task
- **Evidence to Look For**: Concurrent update attempts in logs
- **Test**: Check for simultaneous processing of same task
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

**7.2 Evidence Collection**
- [ ] For each theory, identify what evidence would prove/disprove it
- [ ] Look for specific log patterns that support each hypothesis

### **Phase 8: Fix Strategy** 🔧

**8.1 Immediate Safety Check**
- [ ] Add status validation before any task status update:
```python
def safe_update_task_status(task_id: str, new_status: TaskStatus):
    current_task = get_current_task_status(task_id)
    if is_valid_transition(current_task.status, new_status):
        update_task_status(task_id, new_status)
    else:
        logger.warning(f"Invalid transition blocked: {current_task.status} → {new_status}")
```

**8.2 Long-term Prevention**
- [ ] Implement state machine validation at the database level
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for all status transitions
- [ ] Create unit tests for edge cases in completion detection
