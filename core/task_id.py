"""
Deterministic Task ID Generation

Provides deterministic task ID generation based on job_id + stage + logical_unit.
This enables tasks to calculate their predecessors' IDs without database lookups,
supporting complex multi-stage parallel workflows.

Key Concepts:
- Logical Unit: The identifier that stays constant across stages (e.g., "tile_x5_y10", "blob.tif")
- Lineage: Tasks in different stages processing the same logical unit form a lineage chain
- Deterministic: Same inputs always produce same task ID

    Generate deterministic task ID from job context and logical unit.

    Formula: SHA256(job_id|stage|logical_unit)[:16]

    The logical_unit is the identifier that remains constant across stages:
    - For raster tiling: "tile_x5_y10"
    - For blob processing: blob file name
    - For batch conversion: file path
    - For single tasks: task type name

    Args:
        job_id: Parent job ID
        stage: Stage number (1, 2, 3, ...)
        logical_unit: Identifier for the work unit

    Returns:
        16-character hexadecimal task ID

    Examples:
        >>> generate_deterministic_task_id("abc123", 2, "tile_x5_y10")
        'd4f8a2b1c3e5d7f9'

    Calculate the task ID of the same logical unit in the previous stage.

    This allows tasks to find their predecessors without database queries:
    - Stage 3 task for "tile_x5_y10" can calculate Stage 2 task ID
    - Stage 2 task can calculate Stage 1 task ID
    - Stage 1 has no predecessor (returns None)
