## üìÇ Contents

### Service Bus (8 files)
Historical documentation from Service Bus implementation (25-26 SEP 2025):

1. **BATCH_COORDINATION_STRATEGY.md** - Batch coordination design
2. **BATCH_PROCESSING_ANALYSIS.md** - Batch processing patterns analysis
3. **SERVICE_BUS_AZURE_CONFIG.md** - Azure configuration notes
4. **SERVICE_BUS_CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Clean architecture proposal
5. **SERVICE_BUS_COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Implementation snapshot
6. **SERVICE_BUS_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md** - Status checklist
7. **SERVICE_BUS_PARALLEL_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Parallel strategy
8. **SIMPLIFIED_BATCH_COORDINATION.md** - Simplified coordination design

**Why Archived**: Service Bus implementation is complete and operational. These docs show the evolution of design decisions that led to the current `core/` architecture.

### BaseController (2 files)
BaseController refactoring documentation (26 SEP 2025):

1. **BASECONTROLLER_REFACTORING_STRATEGY.md** - Refactoring approach
2. **BASECONTROLLER_SPLIT_STRATEGY.md** - Strategy to split God Class

**Why Archived**: BaseController refactoring led to the creation of `core/core_controller.py` with `StateManager` and `OrchestrationManager` composition pattern. Goal achieved.

### Analysis (4 files)
Debugging and design analysis documents (26-28 SEP 2025):

1. **BASECONTROLLER_ANNOTATED_REFACTOR.md** - Detailed 19KB analysis of BaseController
2. **active_tracing.md** - Line-by-line execution trace for sb_hello_world
3. **stuck_task_analysis.md** - Investigation of stuck task bug
4. **postgres_comparison.md** - PostgreSQL vs other storage comparison

**Why Archived**: Valuable for understanding system behavior and design decisions, but specific to debugging sessions. PostgreSQL was chosen, bugs were fixed.

### Obsolete (2 files)
Documents superseded by more comprehensive versions:

1. **BASECONTROLLER_COMPLETE_ANALYSIS.md** - Superseded by ANNOTATED_REFACTOR.md
2. **BASECONTROLLER_SPLIT_ANALYSIS.md** - Superseded by SPLIT_STRATEGY.md

**Why Archived**: Duplicate/earlier versions of analysis. Preserved for completeness but not actively referenced.

## üìù Note on Preservation

These files were **moved, not deleted** to preserve the complete development history. While not actively used, they provide valuable context for:
- Understanding why certain design decisions were made
- Learning from debugging approaches
- Reviewing the evolution of the architecture
- Reference during similar future work
