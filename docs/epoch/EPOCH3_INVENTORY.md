## 📝 Notes

### Critical Files for CoreMachine Extraction

**Source Files**:
1. `controller_service_bus_hello.py` (1,019 lines) - Main extraction source
2. `core/core_controller.py` (400 lines) - Abstract patterns
3. `core/state_manager.py` (540 lines) - Database operations
4. `core/orchestration_manager.py` (400 lines) - Task creation

**Target File**:
- `core/machine.py` (~300-400 lines) - CoreMachine universal orchestrator

### Salvage Rate Calculation

**Reusable Code**:
- core/: 19 files, ~54,700 lines (100% reusable)
- repositories/: 13 files, ~220,000 lines (100% reusable)
- triggers/: 7 files, ~5,000 lines (100% reusable)
- utils/: 2 files, ~550 lines (100% reusable)
- config/exceptions: 2 files, ~800 lines (100% reusable)
- services/: 3 files, ~750 lines (100% reusable)

**Total Reusable**: ~281,800 lines

**Legacy/Archive**:
- Controllers: 6 files, ~3,900 lines (archive)
- Schemas: 5 files, ~1,950 lines (archive)

**Total Legacy**: ~5,850 lines

**Salvage Rate**: 281,800 / (281,800 + 5,850) = **97.9% of code is reusable!**
