## ‚úÖ RECENTLY RESOLVED (13 SEP 2025)

### Poison Queue Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Resolution Date**: 13 SEP 2025 01:54 UTC  
**Problem**: Stage 2 job messages were going to poison queue even though jobs completed successfully

**Root Cause Identified**: 
- When Stage 2 job message was processed, it tried to update job status from PROCESSING ‚Üí PROCESSING
- This invalid status transition caused a validation error and sent the message to poison queue

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `controller_base.py` line 1277-1282 to check if job is already PROCESSING before updating
- Only updates status for initial stage (Stage 1) messages

**Testing Results**:
- ‚úÖ Tested with n=1, 2, 3, 4, 20 - all complete successfully
- ‚úÖ No poison queue messages after fix deployment
- ‚úÖ Idempotency confirmed working (duplicate jobs return same job_id)

### N=2 Completion Bug - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Resolution Date**: 13 SEP 2025 01:42 UTC  
**Problem**: Jobs with exactly n=2 would get stuck in PROCESSING state

**Root Cause**: 
- PostgreSQL function `complete_task_and_check_stage` had a race condition with exactly 2 tasks
- Both Stage 2 tasks would report "1 remaining" instead of counting down to 0

**Solution**: 
- Schema redeploy fixed the issue (cleared state inconsistency)
- N=2 now works correctly with proper countdown (1‚Üí0)

## ‚úÖ RECENTLY RESOLVED (12 SEP 2025)

### Task Handler Execution Error - FIXED
**Resolution Time**: 12 SEP 2025 21:50 UTC
**Problem**: Tasks failing with `AttributeError: 'TaskRegistry' object has no attribute 'get_handler'`
**Solution**: 
- Renamed `service_factories.py` ‚Üí `task_factory.py` (proper naming convention)
- Fixed controller_base.py to use `TaskHandlerFactory.get_handler()` instead of trying to use TaskRegistry directly
- Fixed TaskResult field names (`result_data` and `error_details`)
**Result**: All tasks now execute successfully through completion

### Stage 2 Task Creation Failure - FIXED
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Resolution Date**: 12 SEP 2025
**Problems Fixed**:
1. TaskDefinition to TaskRecord conversion missing in function_app.py lines 1133-1146
2. Config attribute error: config.storage_account_url ‚Üí config.queue_service_url (line 1167)
3. Job completion status not updating after all tasks complete (lines 1221-1237)

**Verification**: Successfully tested with n=2, 3, 5, 10, and 100 tasks
- Idempotency confirmed working (duplicate submissions return same job_id)
- All 200 tasks completed successfully for n=100 test

## üü° IN PROGRESS

### function_app.py Modularization (1251 lines ‚Üí 506 lines) ‚úÖ
**Problem**: function_app.py contains orchestration logic that belongs in controllers
**Goal**: Move queue processing logic to BaseController, simplify function_app.py to just routing
**Started**: 12 SEP 2025
**COMPLETED**: 12 SEP 2025

**Implementation Steps**:
1. [x] **Add orchestration methods to BaseController**
   - [x] `process_job_queue_message(job_message: JobQueueMessage)`
   - [x] `process_task_queue_message(task_message: TaskQueueMessage)`
   - [x] `_handle_stage_completion(job_id, stage)` (private helper)
   - [x] Stage advancement logic integrated
   - [x] Job completion logic integrated

2. [x] **Move helper functions from function_app.py**
   - [x] Removed `_validate_and_parse_queue_message()` - logic in controller
   - [x] Removed `_load_job_record_safely()` - logic in controller
   - [x] Removed `_verify_task_creation_success()` - logic in controller
   - [x] Removed `_mark_job_failed_safely()` - logic in controller

3. [x] **Refactor queue triggers in function_app.py**
   - [x] Simplified `process_job_queue()` to 22 lines
   - [x] Simplified `process_task_queue()` to 22 lines
   - [x] Both now just parse message and delegate to controller

4. [ ] **Testing**
   - [ ] Test hello_world with n=10
   - [ ] Verify stage advancement still works
   - [ ] Confirm job completion still works

**Achieved Outcome**:
- function_app.py: 506 lines (60% reduction from 1251 lines)
- controller_base.py: Enhanced with queue orchestration methods (~360 new lines)
- Clean separation achieved: Controllers orchestrate, Services execute, Triggers route

### Service Handler Auto-Discovery
**Problem**: Service modules not auto-imported, handlers never registered  
**Partial Fix**: Added `import service_hello_world` to function_app.py  
**Remaining Work**:
- [ ] Implement proper auto-discovery mechanism in `util_import_validator.py`
- [ ] Call `auto_discover_handlers()` during function_app startup
- [ ] Test with new service modules

## üü¢ READY TO START (Prioritized)

### 1. Blob Storage Operations Implementation üÜï
**Goal**: Implement centralized blob storage operations with dynamic orchestration  
**Reference**: See `STORAGE_OPERATIONS_PLAN.md` for complete design  
**Status**: Design complete, ready for implementation

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (PRIORITY)
- [ ] Implement `repository_blob.py` with DefaultAzureCredential
- [ ] Update `repository_factory.py` to add `create_blob_repository()` method
- [ ] Test singleton pattern and authentication
- [ ] Verify connection pooling works

#### Phase 2: Basic Operations
- [ ] Create `schema_blob.py` with BlobMetadata and ContainerInventory models
- [ ] Implement `service_blob.py` with task handlers:
  - [ ] `analyze_and_orchestrate` handler (Stage 1 orchestrator)
  - [ ] `extract_metadata` handler (Stage 2 file processor)
  - [ ] `summarize_container` handler
- [ ] Create `controller_container.py` with:
  - [ ] `SummarizeContainerController` (single or multi-stage)
  - [ ] `ListContainerController` (dynamic task generation)
- [ ] Register controllers with JobRegistry

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test with small containers (<500 files)
- [ ] Test with medium containers (500-2500 files)
- [ ] Verify NotImplementedError for >5000 files
