=== MISSING METHODS ANALYSIS ===

REQUIRED BY submit_job trigger:
✅ validate_job_parameters() - EXISTS in all controllers
✅ generate_job_id() - EXISTS in CoreController
✅ create_job_record() - ADDED to controllers
⚠️  queue_job() - MISSING from ServiceBusListProcessor (container controllers)

REQUIRED BY function_app queue processing:
❌ process_job_queue_message() - MISSING from all clean controllers
❌ process_task_queue_message() - MISSING from all clean controllers  
⚠️  get_performance_summary() - EXISTS in ServiceBusHelloWorldController but NOT in ServiceBusListProcessor

CRITICAL MISSING METHODS:
1. queue_job() - needed by ServiceBusListProcessor
2. process_job_queue_message() - needed by all controllers
3. process_task_queue_message() - needed by all controllers
4. get_performance_summary() - needed by ServiceBusListProcessor

These are the core methods for queue message processing!
