Base Repository - Pure Abstract Class

This module provides the abstract base repository class that all storage-specific
repositories inherit from. It contains NO storage implementation details, only
common validation logic, error handling patterns, and logging infrastructure.

Architecture:
    BaseRepository (this file - pure abstract)
        ‚Üì
    Storage-specific bases (PostgreSQLRepository, ContainerRepository, etc.)
        ‚Üì
    Domain-specific repositories (JobRepository, TaskRepository, etc.)

Key Design Principles:
- NO storage backend dependencies
- NO connection management
- NO query execution
- ONLY common patterns and utilities

class BaseRepository(ABC):
    """
    Pure abstract base repository with common validation logic.
    
    This class provides shared functionality for ALL repositories regardless
    of storage backend. It contains NO storage-specific code. This is the root
    of the repository hierarchy and ensures consistent behavior across all
    storage implementations.
    
    Design Philosophy:
    ----------------
    The BaseRepository follows the principle of "composition over inheritance"
    for storage backends while using inheritance for shared behavior. Each
    storage-specific repository (PostgreSQL, Container, etc.) inherits from
    this base and adds its own connection management and query execution.
    
    Inheritance Hierarchy:
    ---------------------
    BaseRepository (this class)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PostgreSQLRepository
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JobRepository
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TaskRepository
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CompletionDetector
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ContainerRepository (future)
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BlobRepository
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ InventoryRepository
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CosmosRepository (future)
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MetadataRepository
    
    Responsibilities:
    ----------------
    - Schema validation using Pydantic models
    - Error handling with consistent patterns
    - Logging setup and configuration
    - Status transition validation for state machines
    - Stage progression validation for workflows
    - Parent-child relationship validation
    
    NOT Responsible For:
    -------------------
    - Connection management (handled by storage-specific subclasses)
    - Query execution (handled by storage-specific subclasses)
    - Storage operations (handled by storage-specific subclasses)
    - Transaction management (storage-specific)
    
    Usage Example:
    -------------
    ```python
    class MyStorageRepository(BaseRepository):
        def __init__(self, connection_params):
            super().__init__()  # Initialize base validation and logging
            self.connection = self._setup_connection(connection_params)
        
        def create_entity(self, entity):
            with self._error_context("entity creation", entity.id):
                # Validation happens automatically through context
                self._execute_storage_operation(entity)
    ```
    
    Thread Safety:
    -------------
    This class is thread-safe for read operations. Write operations should
    be synchronized at the storage layer if needed.
